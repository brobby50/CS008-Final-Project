    <h2>What is GitHub</h2>
    <h3>What is “Git”</h3>
    <p>Git is an open source version control system that was started by Linus Torvalds. Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer that is most famous for creating Linux Kernel, an Operating System that is used today by companies such as Android and Google. Git is a service that helps authors of different software keep track of all the edits made to their project. Documenting all changes made to software is a very difficult and daunting task. It can much too often be the Achilles tendon to many good software engineers. Version control systems such as Git track all modifications made to the software by storing them in a central repository. From there developers can easily download the new software, make more edits, and reupload that software making collaboration very easy. Git also allows users who aren’t contributors to a certain project download the files and use them. If you have any experience using Linux, then you will probably find this process of using GitHub much easier. </p>
    <h4>What is the “Hub”</h4>
    <p>Git is a very useful software, but what makes GitHub so beneficial to developers is the platform which the software stands on. GitHub is its own network where like-minded software developers can post their code and download other’s code as well. This is done through their social networking features. Each GitHub user has their own account and profile. A user’s profile is kind of like their resume. This is because different users can see what projects/works that user has posted. This is important so that you can see what level of expertise a certain user might have. Revisions to code and be publicly discussed by either contributors of the same project, or by the masses. It’s also important to remember that GitHub is available for all users, not just software developers. You can submit almost every type of file. This means that you could be uploading word documents, PowerPoints, spreadsheets, etc. </p>
    <h5>More about the company</h5>
    <p>GitHub was founded in 2008 in San Francisco, California. They currently have a community of 22 million developers and more than 60 million projects (Forbes cloud 100 list). They have gained a lot of traction and are used by many large companies and organizations ranging from General Electric to NASA. GitHub had many offers to be bought out. Specifically, they received a very large offer from Microsoft. The company decided to remain independent and continue maintaining their beneficial platform for developers. This worked out in their favor since as of now GitHub is one of the largest version control software on the market. They offer free software for small teams or independent developers as well as larger, paid-for packages for businesses or larger teams of developers. GitHub has become a sort of industry standard for many developers to showcase their projects to potential employers. GitHub also offers internship and career opportunities for aspiring software developers or people interested in the computer science field. </p>
