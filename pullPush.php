            <td>Now that it’s known how to make a repository as well as branches, it’s like to learn how to make edits. Edits in GitHub are done through commits. A commit is a saved change made to a repository. Once many edits have been made to a webpage, the programmer will send out a special request called a pull request, to see if the changes are good enough to merge the two branches. There will be more information on this below. </td>
